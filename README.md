# [BlueTooth Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/bt-channel/)

This repository is an experiment in using Web Bluetooth to exchange SDP and ICE in order to establish a
WebRTC peer connection with a data channel.

It is related to my other experiment, [QR Channel](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/qr-channel).

## Running

This repository is a static file web application, you don't need to compile or build anything.

Just `start index.html` or see the [**online demo**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/bt-channel/).
