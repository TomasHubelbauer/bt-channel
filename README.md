# [Bluetooth Channel](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/bt-channel/)

This repository is an experiment in using Web Bluetooth to exchange SDP and ICE in order to establish a
WebRTC peer connection with a data channel.

It is related to my other experiment, [QR Channel](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/qr-channel).

**[I have found this is currently not possible using Web Bluetooth](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/issues/231)**

## Running

This repository is a static file web application, you don't need to compile or build anything.

Just `start index.html` or see the [**online demo**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/bt-channel/).

## To-Do

### Wait for beacons support in Web Bluetooth
